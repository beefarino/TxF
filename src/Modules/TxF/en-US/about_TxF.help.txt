SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Provides access to transactional file system features from PowerShell.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The TxF module allows you to execute transactional file system operations
    using standard powershell provider cmdlets.

SUPPORTED TRANSACTIONAL OPERATIONS
    The following cmdlets are currently implemented in this provider:

    * new-item
    * remove-item
    * get-item
    * get-childitem
	* get-content
    * set-content

DEFAULT DRIVES
    Upon import, TxF will mount transactional versions of any valid file system
    drives that exist in your session.  These drives will have the same name
    as their nontransactional counterparts, prefaced with an 'X'.

    For instance, the nontransactional C drive would have an equivalent
    transactional drive named XC.

EXAMPLE
    # import the TxF module
    > import-module txf

    # move to the transactional c drive
    > cd xc:\tmp
    
    # start a transaction
    > Start-Transaction
    
    # create a new file inside of the transation
    > new-item -name txfile.txt -type file -UseTransaction
    
    # locate the new file using the current transaction
    > dir tx*.* -UseTransaction
    
    # fail to locate the new file by not using the current transaction
    > dir tx*.*
    
    # commit the current transaction
    > Complete-Transaction
    
    # and now the file appears in the directory
    > dir tx*.*
